# All this won't work as Symfony uses a kind of autodiscovery to find it's way into the database:
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html#docker-integration
# As long as using a dockerized environment, the following data will be overwritten
#doctrine:
#    dbal:
#        url: 'mysql://criticalmass:criticalmass@127.0.0.1:8002/criticalmass_test'
